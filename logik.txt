So I got a way to retreive information from the screen about the application running and it's duration 
until the screen changed. so umm yeah now how do I store that data

The eventual broader plan is, to store data per 24 hour basis and then it gets stored into 
weekly and monthly basis stats and one can view it. average of weeks, average per month etc.

so step 0 is to just store the data,
will use postgres

def collect_app_usage_data():
    # Placeholder for the actual logic that collects app name and duration
    app_name = 'some_app'
    duration = 300  # Duration in seconds

    # Insert collected data into the database
    insert_screen_time(app_name, duration)

need to do something like this.

what will be database schema?
app name: varchar
duration: float

that's it ig, nothing much needed.

need to see how can I aggregate into weekly basis and monthly basis to average out

so the strategy is:
collect data but only display data based on current date, lolzy damn.
and weekly data just aggregate the data per week basis and create a new relation
then aggregate the daily data for monthly basis into a new table and display it.
Screw tkinter, will use a web based frontend, I will use the backend to collect the data,
and to display it will use react and next js, I just need to fetch data from postgres that's it.

alright let's just connect the database with this ducker
