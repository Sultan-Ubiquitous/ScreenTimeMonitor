So I got a way to retreive information from the screen about the application running and it's duration 
until the screen changed. so umm yeah now how do I store that data

The eventual broader plan is, to store data per 24 hour basis and then it gets stored into 
weekly and monthly basis stats and one can view it. average of weeks, average per month etc.

so step 0 is to just store the data,
will use postgres

def collect_app_usage_data():
    # Placeholder for the actual logic that collects app name and duration
    app_name = 'some_app'
    duration = 300  # Duration in seconds

    # Insert collected data into the database
    insert_screen_time(app_name, duration)

need to do something like this
